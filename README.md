# TwitchChatbot
A simple chatbot for Twitch written in Ruby. Used for handling commands and previewing chat so that you don't need to have the browser open and can avoid using a lot of RAM and CPU.

I use this chatbot to preview chat without having a browser open so that I save CPU and RAM.
But as you can see in the preview image it's also able to handle custom commands including API commands.

----

## How To Use:  
1. Open **"credentials.txt"** and replace OAUTH, BOTNAME and CHANNEL with the values you need.
2. Run **"TwitchBot.rb"**

----  

## **Adding Commands:**  
### **Regular Commands:**  
1. Open **"CommandsHandler.rb"** and scroll down to the `commands` array and add your own.
2. Go to folder **"Responses"** and add the command as a text file in all lowercase. _Examples have been included_  

### **Admin Commands:**  
If you are adding admin commands add a custom response next to it. There you'll be able to add commands that gives data to the socket instead of a chat message as a response. Example:  
    `admin_commands = {
		"disconnect" => "PART ##{CHANNEL}"
		}`  
  
When the command `"!disconnect"` has been typed in chat by the channel owner _(or anyone specified in the `admins` array)_ it will send a request to disconnect from the current Twitch channel.

### **API Commands:**  
If you want to add API commands you just scroll down to `# ----- API COMMANDS ----- #` _(First section after receiving messages)_ and add your commands. In the example it calls some functions which are made at the bottom of the script.

Then you scroll down to the bottom under `# ----- API COMMANDS ----- #` and add a function to that command.
